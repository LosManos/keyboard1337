An installer is included in the download so the program above is not needed.

If you only want to create a control button of the caps lock - use a program fr√•n Mark Russinovich instead.

The language is installed as a English/US keyboard.  This means that on Win7 (/Vista?) you look for English/US and under that find 1337.
