## Better programming keyboard layout for Swedish hackers

### Stop pressing shift every time you need a paranthesis or equals sign

I got tired of having to press shift every time i wanted to write a parenthesis, bracket, måsvinge, quotation mark, pound or at sign. So I used a US keyboard and swapped the top row so now I don't have to press shift for these often used characters. Instead one presses shift for the numbers.

I takes a second to learn and is so much nicer to use.

### Keep the ÅÄÖ

It has ÅÄÖ as the swedish layout. They are reached through altgr-{normal position} in Windows and shift-alt-{normal position} in OSX.

If you want to get back to your old Swedish layout just press shift-alt in Windows or corresponding combination in OSX.

### Installation on Windows

The Windows version uses a layout and install program from Microsoft.

### Installation on OSX

The OSX version uses a program called Ukelele for layout. Installment is usual OSX stuff as Ukelele has documented. I have noticed a caveat where the new layout or bundle doesn't get changed at once but I can't remember my findings. Just remember that installment is sightly rocky and not the smooth just-works we are used to.

## Other stuff

A keyboard layout program from Microsoft is needed to use the layout file. http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/tools/msklc.mspx http://www.microsoft.com/DOWNLOADS/details.aspx?FamilyID=8be579aa-780d-4253-9e0a-e17e51db2223&displaylang=en

An installer is included in the download so the program above is not needed.

If you only want to create a control button of the caps lock - use a program från Mark Russinovich instead. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897578.aspx

You can also use Authotkey for using capslock as an extra modifier key. (the combined with Visual studio and Resharper this does not always work though)

The language is installed as a English/US keyboard. This means that on Win7/8/10 (/Vista?) you look for English/US and under that find 1337.
