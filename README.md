## Better programming keyboard layout for Swedish hackers

I got tired of having to press shift every time i wanted to write a parenthesis, bracket, måsvinge, quotation mark, pound or at sign. So I used a US keyboard and swapped the top row so now I don't have to press shift for these often used characters. Instead one presses shift for the numbers.

I takes a second to learn and is so much nicer to use.

It has ÅÄÖ as the swedish layout. They are reached through altgr-{normal position} in Windows and shift-alt-{normal position} in OSX.

If you want to get back to your old Swedish layout just press shift-alt in Windows or corresponding combination in OSX.

The Windows version uses a layout and install program from Microsoft. More information <a href="https://code.google.com/p/keyboard1337/wiki/PageName">here</a>.

The OSX version uses a program called Ukelele for layout. Installment is usual OSX stuff as Ukelele has documented. I have noticed a caveat where the new layout or bundle doesn't get changed at once but I can't remember my findings. Just remember that installment is sightly rocky and not the smooth just-works we are used to.
